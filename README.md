# 🚀 `Huxn WebDev React JS Course – Part 1 (Progress Tracker)`

This repository is dedicated to tracking my `learning journey` through the **`Huxn WebDev React JS Course – Part 1`**. The `complete Part 1` spans approximately **`13 hours`** and covers a wide range of `React fundamentals` and `advanced concepts.`

## ✅ `Course Overview`

The course focuses on:

- Building modern web applications using `**React JS**`
- Understanding the core fundamentals and hooks
- Implementing `state management` using `React features`
- Enhancing reusability with custom hooks
- Practical examples and `UI implementations`

---

## 📅 `Current Progress`

- **Total Course Length**: ~12 Hours  
- **Completed**: ✅ First 4 Hours  
- **Remaining**: ⏳ ~9 Hours

---

## 🧠 `What I’ve Learned So Far (Up to 4 Hours)`

### ✅ `React Basics`
- JSX
- Components `(Functional)`
- Props & Events
- State basics

### ✅ `React Hooks Covered`
- `useState` – Managing `local state` in components
- `useReducer` – Managing more complex state logic
- `useEffect` – Side effects, lifecycle simulation
- `useId` – Generating unique IDs (great for accessibility or form fields)
- `useRef` – Referencing `DOM elements` and storing `mutable values`
- Custom Hooks – Creating reusable logic across components

---

## 🛠️ `Upcoming Topics (Expected in Remaining Hours)`
> *Based on course structure and syllabus outline*

- Advanced hooks (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`)
- Routing with `React Router`
- Context API
- Form `handling` and `validation`
- React best practices and performance optimization
- Basic project or `UI integration` examples

---

## 💡 `My Takeaways So Far`

- React is `powerful` yet approachable once you grasp the core idea of `components` and `state.`
- Hooks like `useReducer` make complex state logic more maintainable.
- Custom hooks encourage cleaner and more `reusable code structures.`
- Side effects and `DOM references` are easily managed with `useEffect` and `useRef`.

## 📌 `Notes`

I’ll continue updating this README as I make progress through the rest of the course. My aim is to solidify my `React fundamentals` before moving to project-based learning and full-stack development.

---

## 🧭 `Next Steps`

- Complete the remaining 9 hours
- Start applying concepts through `small projects`
- Dive into `React Router` and `Context API`
- Practice `component structure` and `state management`
